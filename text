My GoMyCode Journey From Curiosity to Confidence
When I first joined GoMyCode, I wasn't exactly sure what to expect. I had no prior experience in programming and wasn’t even sure if I could grasp the concepts. But I took the leap and today, as the bootcamp wraps up, I’m truly glad I did.
Choosing Software Development turned out to be one of the best decisions I’ve made. It’s a dynamic, challenging field that constantly pushes you to grow. Throughout this journey, I’ve gained hands-on experience with powerful tools and technologies I never imagined I'd understand let alone use confidently.
One highlight for me was building a full MERN stack application (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) that performs full CRUD operations. A few months ago, this would have felt impossible. Now, it feels like just the beginning of what's to come.
I'm walking away from this bootcamp not just with technical skills, but with a mindset ready to solve real world problems.
To anyone unsure about starting their tech journey take the leap. You may surprise yourself.
